  <p>Want to test out your thinking skills? Critical thinking is a kind of thinking in which you question analyze interpret, evaluate,
    and make a judgement about what you read, hear, or say, or write. Many why grew up in America have been taught to consume information
    by memorization and repetition. However, what the education system lacks is to have students think and create conclusions for themselves. 
    This project aims to challenge your brain by presenting randomly generated concepts and finding a connection between them. Happy Thinking!
